# Caroon-Bot
A discord bot for the Caroon community

## How to run
A YAML config file named _config.yml needs to be created. Currently it has to cointain the following information:
```YAML
prefix: 'your preferred prefix here'
tokens: 
    discord: 'your token for connecting to the bot'
```
This file should never be pushed to the Github repository as the token is to be kept secret.
